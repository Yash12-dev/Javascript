Hello everybody, this is a DoorDash and Uber Eats Tablet interface Clone using HTML and CSS Clone. 
For the DoorDash Tab interface, I have incorported a Display flexbox functions to align the items indivdiually in the interface.
However for the Uber Eats Tablet interface Clone, I have incorporated a Display grid function in which I have used a display grid template function to align the items collectively.
